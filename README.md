### **LOTRO BARD Controller Suite**

### 

### **Transform your musical experience!**



*Are you a LOTRO player tired of the clunky QWERTY keyboard interface as a musical instrument?*

*The LBC is a controller suite that serves as your all-in-one toolkit for seamless, expressive music-making in-game. ╬

*Designed for LOTRO players/musician bard types, this app bridges the gap between real-world MIDI*

*instruments and the immersive world of Middle-earth on the sound stage.*



First a shout out to [xEdziu](https://github.com/xEdziu/midi2key). I went looking for a MIDI2KEY solution, but some were so antiquated they simply would not run on Windows 11. I couldn't find a mechanism anywhere that would allow selecting multiple MIDI devices, of which I have several operating in tandem. So I took a chance building off of this. I'm happy with the results.



I imagine this would work with any application with the right keybinds associated, although there are several games that do not allow some scripts that could be interpreted as an anti-cheat, so the player uses this at his/r own risk.

MAKE SURE YOU RUN THIS AS ADMINISTRATOR!



*Update: You can now use C1 and D1 to toggle between the main (ARP) tab and the second tab (Chords) and more importantly can select which scale or chord by pressing the black keys (C1# and D1#)!*

###### **Bugs \& Limitations**

The app is optimized for playing within the root scale. Notes can travel up to two scales, matching typical player XP progression, but has not been tested (I'm not high enough level yet!)


I cannot get the ABC player to discriminate chords from single notes, therefore chords are played as an arpeggiated note sequence rather than simultaneously. 



###### Timing Discrepancies:

Timing is managed but may not be perfect, especially at higher pitches.

All single notes playback reliably.



###### Keybind Limitations:

Some advanced chords or scales may require creative key combinations due to LOTROs

keybind constraints.

**If this gets traction I would like to:**



✅	**Make use of the keybed to control the ARP scales and chord types (DONE!)**

❌	**Make use of the pitchbend wheel and/or ribbon to control ARP sequences choices and chord types (will not work, midi message controls limited to notes)**

◯	**Extend this to three octaves (I found several challenges awaited me. IF someone wants to do a pull request, take a crack at it... be my guest.)**
